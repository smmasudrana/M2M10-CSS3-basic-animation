        <div class="flowbox">
            <p>In the name of Allah, Most Compassionate, Most Merciful, The issue of organ transplantation has been a
                matter of great debate amongst the great contemporary scholars from around the globe. It has been
                discussed in various fiqh seminars, and many short and detailed works have be compiled on the subject.
                The majority of the Indo/Pak scholars are of the view that organ transplant is not permissible, while
                many Arab scholars and some scholars of the Indian subcontinent give its permission under certain
                conditions, (details of these conditions will be mentioned further along). No one has given a general
                unconditional permission for the transplantation of organs.It must be remarked here that this issue is
                contemporary and obviously it is impossible for us to find express rulings concerning it in the
                classical works. As such, the views of the contemporary scholars are based upon the general and broad
                guidelines of Shariah. It is obvious that this will result in difference of opinion, thus no one opinion
                should be condemned, as the intention of all the scholars is to please Allah, and live a life that is in
                accordance with Shariah.1) The view of impermissibility

                As mentioned earlier, the majority of the Indo/Pak scholars hold the view that organ transplantation
                cannot be deemed permissible due to the harms and ill effects of it overcoming the potential benefits

                Their view is based on the following grounds:

                a) The first and foremost is that Allah Almighty has honored the human.

                Allah Most High says:

                “And verily we have honored the children of Adam.” (Surah al-Isra, V.70)

                As such, it is a well-established principle of Shariah that all the organs of a human body, whether one
                is a Muslim or a non-Muslim, are sacred and must not be tampered with. To take benefit from any part of
                a human is unlawful (haram).

                Allah Almighty made humans the best of creations and created everything for their benefit. Allah Most
                High Says:

                “It is He, who has created for you all things that are on earth.” (Surah al-Baqarah, 2.29)

                Thus, it is permissible for a human to benefit from every creation of Allah which includes animals
                (under certain conditions), plants, and inanimate things. As such, it would be unreasonable to place
                humans in the same category of the above things by giving permission to use parts and derive benefit out
                of their body that necessitates cutting, chopping and amputating parts of the body. This is certainly
                unreasonable and unlawful on a human body.

                A very famous Hadith prevents the usage of human parts. Sayyida Asma bint Abi Bakr (Allah be pleased
                with her) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him peace) said: “Allah’s curse
                is on a woman who wears false hair (of humans) or arranges it for others.” (Sahih Muslim, no. 2122)

                Imam al-Nawawi (Allah have mercy on him) writes in the explanation of this Hadith:

                “If human hair is used, then it is unlawful by consensus, whether it’s the hair of a man or woman,
                because of the general narrations that prohibit this. And also, it is unlawful to take benefit from the
                hair and all other organs of a human body due to its sanctity. The hair of a human, along with all its
                body-parts must be buried.” (Commentary of Sahih Muslim by Nawawi, p. 1600)
